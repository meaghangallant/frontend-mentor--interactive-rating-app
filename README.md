### What I Learned 

That you can use negative values and extend past 100% when creating gradients (mind blown emoji here). I am so excited to have figured out this part and be able to replicate it from the imahe!! #veryproud

```CSS
#app-container {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, hsla(213, 20%, 18%, 1) -50%, hsla(216, 12%, 8%, .5) 150%);
}
```
