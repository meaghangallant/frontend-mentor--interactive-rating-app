### What I Learned 

#### Lesson 1
That you can use negative values and extend past 100% when creating gradients (mind blown emoji here). I am so excited to have figured out this part and be able to replicate it from the imahe!! #veryproud

```CSS
#app-container {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, hsla(213, 20%, 18%, 1) -50%, hsla(216, 12%, 8%, .5) 150%);
}
```

#### Lesson 2
CHECK YOUR SPELLING, CHECK YOUR SPELLING, CHECK YOUR SPELLING 
AND!!! >>> Check your letter casing!
ALSO!!!!!! >>> triple check you are using the correct name of the method/property/etc you are trying to use

shout out to me banging my head against a wall for an hour trying to figure out why my code wasn't working when I was consistently writing document.getElementsByClassName() as .getElementByClass() (happy tear emoji here)


#### Lesson 3
You should probablly save any/all code progress even -- if not ESPECIALLY -- code that isn't working (please see above lesson (happy tear emoji) )
